I am Professor of Sustainable Engineering at the School of Engineering, Cardiff University, UK.

## Research interests

As an interdisciplinary academic, I work in the broader field of **smart, resilient and sustainable buildings and cities**, with a focus on the cross-cutting areas linking _climate_ (anthropogenic change mitigation, and adaptation), **energy** (demand vs. supply, building and district energy systems, smart grids, renewable energy, and decarbonisation), and **environment** (sustainable building and urban design, and urban thermal island)---underpinned by methods from _building physics_ (modelling and simulation), _information technology_ (building information modelling--BIM, computational intelligence, and remote sensing) and _environmental psychology_---with the end goal being the **development of new methods, processes and tools to enhance the policy and practice of sustainable development**.

## Research summary

After graduating in Architecture in 1999 and a short spell as a Lecturer, I started PhD in 2001 at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/civileng/) (UCC) to investigate the role of [building simulation and mathematical optimisation in sustainable architectural design](https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/10292/7/MourshedThesis.pdf). I developed ArDOT,
a BIM-based software framework for multi-domain, multicriteria optimisation of buildings to minimise energy consumption at optimum indoor environmental conditions. The PhD research was recognised with an
[International Building Performance Simulation
Association](http://ibpsa.org) award and laid the foundation for subsequent research in optimisation, and design of high performance buildings.

Post PhD, I moved to [Loughborough University](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/) in 2007, after being at the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.uclan.ac.uk/) lecturing architectural design and technology for 2003--07. At Loughborough, I
[worked](http://www.haciric.org/about-us/our-people/researchers) in the interstitial areas of [building simulation](http://www.haciric.org/our-projects/WP2-Delivery-of-enhanced-performance-and-value-through-the-application-of-advanced-modelling-simulation-and-visualisation-to-the-design-and-operation-of-healthcare-facilities/), [design optimisation](http://www.haciric.org/our-projects/Develop-a-decision-support-system-through-modelling-and-simulation-to-optimise-lighting-design-of-healthcare-spaces/) and [environmental psychology](http://www.haciric.org/our-projects/Identify-and-develop-theory-on-various-performance-indicators-parameters-and-modelling-approaches-to-be-considered-during-the-design-of-healthcare-facilities/) as part of the Â£11M [EPSRC funded](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/D039614/1) [Health and Care Infrastructure Research and Innovation Centre, HaCIRIC](http://www.haciric.org/)---exploring the
**relationship between physical environments, projected increases in temperature, and occupant health and wellbeing**. I was a [Co-I in the EPSRC project](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=TS/H002782/1) that developed a simulation-based
optimisation tool for minimising building carbon emissions and water use. I also secured two grants as PI from the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/) and
\[Department of Energy and Climate Change, DECC\](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-
climate-change) on
**adaptable cities** and **2050 energy pathways** for
Bangladesh respectively---marking a shift in the scope of my work---from _individual buildings_ to _cities and regions_.

After moving to [Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk) in
2013, I led the \[DECC\](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-
climate-change)-funded development of
[**2050 national energy, emissions and
food pathways for Bangladesh**](http://www.bd2050.org), in association with industry, academia
and the governments of UK and Bangladesh. The research focused on the **socio-economic evolution of energy demand** and how the increasing demand can be met in a without **affecting energy security and carbon intensity**. Key innovations include the
[open-source release](https://github.com/mmourshed/twenty-fifty) of the entire underlying model and dataset for an energy-informed debate on
policies. I secured four grants from the European commission (Horizon 2020 and
FP7), primarily focussing on **resource efficiency** (energy and water) in the built environment. In
[MAS2TERING](http://www.mas2tering.eu/), I lead the
development of a multi-agent systems platform for optimal management of the electricity generated by _prosumers_ in a district, enabling new business model for **house as a power plant**, in association
with European utilities. THERMOSS takes the concept further to include district heating systems. In the PERFORMER project, the focus is
on improving the understanding of the **interactions between users, buildings and energy systems**, as well as on the development of **resource-efficient and resilient built environment**. In addition
to my research, I am actively invovled in the development of standards
and processes through the committee memberships in
[IEEE](http://www.ieee.org) and
[ASHRAE](http://www.ashrae.org) on **smart cities and climate change** respectively.
