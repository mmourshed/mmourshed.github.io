# m.mourshed.org

Repo for personal website of Monjur Mourshed, an academic at Cardiff University. Visit the site [here](http://m.mourshed.org)

The site is written in Markdown and hosted as a repository in [Githb](http://github.io). Every time an update is pushed to the repository, the markdown pages are transformed automatically by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) into a static site. I used [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a two-column theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
